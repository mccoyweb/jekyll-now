Huanchaco may be our favorite place in Peru so far. The town has a laid back feel. It's an interesting mix of surfer/hippies and local tourists visiting from mountain towns. I'm surprised at the number of Peruvians surfing. It's clearly not just for tourists but also a popular local hobbie. It's located close to the much larger Trjillo, but still manages to maintain a laid back feeling.
